A Board Game
Problem Description
You are given an N x N grid of squares. Each square except the top left is filled with a positive integer.
You start at the top left corner with a score of 0 and move to the bottom right square by moving either right by one
square or down by one square. As you move to the new square, your score becomes [S/2] + k, where S was the score at
your previous square and k is the number written in the current square. In the above, [x] is the largest integer
which is not greater than x. Thus, [5] is 5, and [5.5] is also 5.

Write a program to find the smallest score with which you can exit the grid.

Constraints
4 <= N <= 30

Number in each square <= 1000

Input Format
The first line contains a single integer N, representing the size of the grid

The next N lines, each having N space separated integers giving the numbers written on successive rows of the grid

Output
The smallest score with which you can exit the grid
